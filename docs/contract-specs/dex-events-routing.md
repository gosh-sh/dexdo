# DEX.DO Event Routing

This document catalogs every `event` defined under `contracts`: when it is emitted, which `dst` address it is routed to, and which events are currently declared only and not actually emitted.

## General principle

`dst` only exists on external event objects created via `emit Event{dest: ...}(...)`.

This codebase uses three modes:

| Case | Routed to |
| --- | --- |
| Regular external events | `address.makeAddrExtern(EVENT_ID, bitCntAddress)` |
| Special `OrderBook` channels | `address.makeAddrExtern(0, bitCntAddress)` |
| Event only declared | no `dst`, because there is no `emit` |

## RootPN

| Event | Fields | Emitted | Destination (`dst`) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VoucherGenerated` | `skUCommit`, `voucherNominal`, `tokenType` | In `generateVoucher()` after the nominal check and a possible `SHELL -> SHELL_FEE` remap. | `address.makeAddrExtern(VAULT_voucher_GENERATED, bitCntAddress)` = `135` | [RootPN.sol:427](../../contracts/RootPN.sol:427) |
| `PrivateNoteDeployed` | `depositIdentifierHash`, `noteAddress`, `initialBalance` | In the `privateNoteDeployed()` callback after `_deployedValues[tokenType]` is incremented. | `address.makeAddrExtern(ROOTPN_PRIVATE_NOTE_DEPLOYED, bitCntAddress)` = `101` | [RootPN.sol:339](../../contracts/RootPN.sol:339) |
| `NullifierDeployed` | `nullifierAddress`, `value` | In `sendEccShellToPrivateNote()` after the zk check succeeds and the `Nullifier` is deployed. | `address.makeAddrExtern(ROOTPN_NULLIFIER_DEPLOYED, bitCntAddress)` = `102` | [RootPN.sol:247](../../contracts/RootPN.sol:247) |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OracleEventListDeployed` | `eventListAddress`, `index`, `description` | In the `Oracle` constructor for the default list with `index = 0` and an empty description, and in `deployEventList()` for additional lists with the caller-supplied description. | `address.makeAddrExtern(ORACLE_DEPLOYED, bitCntAddress)` = `104` | [Oracle.sol:71](../../contracts/Oracle.sol:71), [Oracle.sol:88](../../contracts/Oracle.sol:88) |

| `OrderFilledConfirmed` | `orderBook`, `orderId`, `outcomeId`, `filledAmount`, `clearingPrice`, `isBuy`, `feeAmount`, `isFinal` | In `onOrderFilled()` after the local balances / stakes / fee reserves / locks are updated for the fill reported by `OrderBook`. | `address.makeAddrExtern(PRIVATENOTE_ORDER_FILLED, bitCntAddress)` = `148` | [PrivateNote.sol:2073](../../contracts/PrivateNote.sol:2073) |
| `OrderPlaceRejected` | `orderBook`, `eventId`, `clientOrderId`, `outcomeId`, `isBuy`, `flags`, `price`, `amount`, `opNonce` | In `onOrderRejected()` after the buy-lock or sell-lock has been released. Carries the full original `PlaceParams` so off-chain monitors can attribute the rejection back to its `clientOrderId`. | `address.makeAddrExtern(PRIVATENOTE_ORDER_REJECTED, bitCntAddress)` = `153` | [PrivateNote.sol:1717](../../contracts/PrivateNote.sol:1717) |
